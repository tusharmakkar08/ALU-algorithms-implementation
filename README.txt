This project is all about implementing and stimulating basic ALU algorithms in  Python Language
The following CPU algorithms are implemented :
1- Addition and Subtraction using adders and subtractors
2- Multiplication using partial products
3- Division using successive subtraction and Newton Raphson Method
4- GCD using Euclid's Algorithm
5- All the logical operations using basic gates properties
6- Static Daisy Chain Algorithm
7- Rotating Daisy Chain Algorithm
